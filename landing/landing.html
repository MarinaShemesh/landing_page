            <p>"Since I started to listen to the Joe Rogan podcast I learned a lot about the work of today's leading
                scientists.
                Not only am I more informed but the hours of listening to clever people has definitely made me smarter!"

            <p>"Great Podcast. I like JRE because Joe has a wide variety of guests. Everyone from Celebrities to
                Scientists. I always learn something and I like how Joe doesn't ask the same questions as everyone else
                does."

            <p>"When this show is good, itâ€™s really good. Joe gets some of the most interesting guests imaginable and
                often the chemistry between them is great and conversation flows so naturally."
