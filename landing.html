                scientists.
                Not only am I more informed but the hours of listening to clever people has definitely made me smarter!"

            <p>"Great Podcast. I like JRE because Joe has a wide variety of guests. Everyone from Celebrities to
                Scientists. I always learn something and I like how Joe doesn't ask the same questions as everyone else
                does."

                Jack Gallant, a neuroscientist from UC Berkly found that there is an obvious link between <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-music-podcasts-affect-your-brain-21948016"> narrative

                Listen to people like Elon Musk chat about his projects without getting interrupted for ad breaks or

                Tired of being spoon-fed the agendas of nameless executives? Podcast hosts cut out the gatekeepers and
                make
                the listeners their first priority.
